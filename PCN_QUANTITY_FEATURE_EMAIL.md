# Email: PCN Quantity Feature Feedback Request

**Subject:** Quick Question: PCN Quantity Behavior Preference

**To:** KOSH Users

Hi team,

We're reviewing a feature for PCN generation and would like your input.

**Current Behavior:**
When you generate a PCN, it sets the initial quantity based on what you enter.

**Proposed Alternative:**
Generate PCN with quantity = 0, requiring you to use the STOCK operation to add inventory afterward.

**Question:** Which approach works better for your workflow?

Option A: Keep current (quantity set during PCN generation)
Option B: Switch to zero-quantity (requires separate STOCK step)

Please reply with your preference (A or B) and any brief comments.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
